Yes — a few days is often how long it takes for wax to naturally loosen and come out safely. Here’s what that means in practice:

🕐 Typical timeline

1. Day 1–2:

    Start by softening the wax. Use 3–4 drops of an earwax softener (like Debrox or a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, or diluted hydrogen peroxide) once or twice a day.
2. Day 3–4:

    The wax should begin to loosen and move outward. Some people notice improved hearing or wax coming out on its own during this period.
3. After 4 days:

    If it still feels blocked, you can gently rinse with a rubber bulb syringe and body-temperature water (never hot). Often, this clears the ear completely.

🧼 Why it takes days

Earwax is sticky and compacted in some cases. Softening agents work gradually, allowing the wax to absorb moisture and break down without damaging the skin or eardrum. Fast or forceful removal attempts — especially with cotton swabs — risk pushing it deeper or causing injury.

🩺 If it’s still blocked after 4–5 days

At that point, it’s best to see a clinician. They can remove the wax safely using suction or special tools in just a few minutes.

Would you like me to outline a 2–4 day home care schedule with exact steps (drops, rinse, precautions)?
